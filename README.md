# Gravity
### Wentworth Institute Of Technology

# Why
* We have a very basic problem description which became very complicated extremely quickly…
“Develop a JavaFX application which simulates the orbits of planets around a central star (mimicking the effects of gravity) in 3D.”
* Our group decided to develop this project as a way to gain in-depth knowledge of astrodynamics and how it can be applied for scientific computation. If developed further, this project would applications in predicting the orbits of satellites based on initial velocities and mass.

# Download & Run
* Clone the repository using eclipse
* Add the repostiory to the eclipse workspace
* Run the 


# How To Navigate
This simulation lets you utilize the keyboard to traverse the three dimensional plane.  It also gives you access to the fourth dimensions with a play pause function. It comes with two starting views that are reccomeneded by us but feel free to explore.

### Rotation

* A: Rotates camera to the left
* D: Rotates camera to the right
* S: Rotates camera downwards
* W: Rotates Camera upwards
* F: Switches how quickly the other keys will rotate the camera between two settings

### Traversing

* UP-Arrow: Either moves foward or upwards depending on the enter modifier
* DOWN-Arrow: Either moves backwards or downwards depending on the enter modifier
* LEFT-Arrow: Moves the camera left
* RIGHT-Arrow: Moves the camera right
* ENTER: Switches a modifier that changes whether the up and down keys are moving the y or the z axis.

### Misc

* L: Changes the lighting, try it!
* R: Brings the camera to a rightside view of the galaxy
* SPACE: Brings the camera to an aerial view of the galaxy.
* P: Starts or pauses time
